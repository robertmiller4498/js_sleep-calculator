# js_sleep-calculator
Second project working with javascript. Created a sleep calculator that returns whether or not the user is getting an appropriate amount of sleep. Requires user input. Project was originally done on Codecademy.


For extra practice, try these:

getActualSleepHours() could be implemented without calling getSleepHours(). Use literal numbers and the + operator to rewrite getActualSleepHours(). It should still return the total actual hours slept in the week.

Some people need to sleep longer than others. Rewrite getIdealSleepHours() so that you can pass it an argument, like getIdealSleepHours(8) where 8 is the ideal hours per night. Update the call to getIdealSleepHours() in calculateSleepDebt() too.
